We have two postdoc openings. The postdocs will mainly stay at the University of Edinburgh with at least two-month visit in Shanghai; the expenses of Sino-UK trips will be covered. Hence, it will be a great opportunity for candidates who are intested in working in different enviroment. If you are interested in, please email either me or Professor Ramon Grima.
